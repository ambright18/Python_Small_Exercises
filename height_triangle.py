# a python exercise program that will compute the base and height of a triangle

#first, let's have the user input the base and height

base = int(input("Enter the base here: "))
height = int(input("Enter the height here: "))

#create a variable to hold our calculation
area = base * height / 2

print("The Area = ", area)
